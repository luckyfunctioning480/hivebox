# Build the HiveBox base rootfs image.
#
# Creates the Alpine base squashfs image used as the read-only lower
# layer for sandbox overlayfs mounts.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Must run as root (for chroot and mount operations)
#   - Must be on Alpine Linux or inside an Alpine container (for apk)
#   - Packages: squashfs-tools wget tar
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build-images.sh
#
# The image is written to /var/lib/hivebox/images/ by default.
# Override with the HIVEBOX_IMAGES_DIR environment variable.
#
# To pre-install packages in all sandboxes, edit images/base.sh.
# For per-sandbox packages, use: hivebox exec <sandbox> -- apk add <package>
