**Native Linux sandboxing built for the AI era.**

HiveBox turns Alpine Linux into a platform where sandboxing is a first-class primitive. No containers, no VMs — just direct kernel isolation (namespaces, cgroups, seccomp, Landlock) exposed through a simple CLI and REST API.

Each **hivebox** is a lightweight, isolated Linux sandbox with its own [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) AI agent. Launch thousands on a single host — each running arbitrary commands in complete isolation with near-zero overhead, and each with a dedicated AI coding assistant accessible via API or the built-in web dashboard.

## Stop sandboxing everything.

The AI industry has a proportionality problem. Every major platform spins up full Ubuntu containers — mounted filesystems, browsers, CLI tools, isolated networks — for every user interaction. A .pptx, a .docx, a .xlsx, a PDF, a CSV export. Tasks that take milliseconds with a lightweight library are burning entire virtual machines in the cloud.

To generate a 10-slide presentation, a small virtual computer boots. To format a Word document with headers, a container spins up. To create a spreadsheet with a few formulas, an isolated network is allocated. None of this requires a sandbox. It requires a function call.

The hidden cost is real:

- A single AI query consumes **10x more energy** than a traditional search
- Running workloads in Docker containers produces a [measurable increase in energy consumption](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.suscom.2023.100889) vs. bare Linux, due to I/O overhead
- U.S. AI data centers are projected to emit **24-44 million metric tons of CO2/year by 2030** and consume water equivalent to **6-10 million Americans** ([Cornell, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-025-00410-9))

But when you *do* need isolation — running untrusted code, AI agents executing arbitrary commands, multi-tenant environments — you need it done right, and you need it done light.

HiveBox is the proportionate answer: kernel-native isolation with near-zero overhead. No container runtime. No hypervisor. Just the Linux kernel doing what it already knows how to do.

| | Docker | gVisor | Firecracker | Daytona | **HiveBox** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Memory per sandbox | ~50 MB | ~30 MB | ~5 MB | ~50 MB+ (Docker-based) | **~2-5 MB** |
| Startup time | ~1 s | ~0.5 s | ~125 ms | ~90 ms (warm) | **~10-50 ms** |
| Isolation | Namespaces | Syscall emulation | Hypervisor | Docker (managed) | **NS + seccomp + Landlock** |
| Self-hosted | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (cloud also available, pay-per-second) | **Yes** |
| Complexity | High | Medium | Medium | High (requires Docker Compose) | **Low** |

Same security. A fraction of the resources. The smartest infrastructure is the one that uses the minimum needed for the task.

## Deploy

One command on any Linux VPS (Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, etc.):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TetiAI/hivebox/main/scripts/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

This installs Docker (if needed), pulls the latest image, generates an API key, and starts HiveBox. The dashboard is available at `http://your-server:7070/dashboard`.

To pass custom configuration:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TetiAI/hivebox/main/scripts/setup.sh | \
  HIVEBOX_API_KEY=your-key \
  HIVEBOX_OPENCODE_API_KEY=sk-... \
  HIVEBOX_OPENCODE_MODEL=your-model \
  sudo -E bash
```

All settings are saved in `/opt/hivebox/.env` and persist across restarts.

## Quick Start

### CLI

```bash
# Create a hivebox
hivebox create --name myagent --memory 512m

# Execute commands in it
hivebox exec myagent -- echo "hello from the hivebox"
hivebox exec myagent -- pip install requests numpy
hivebox exec myagent -- python3 scraper.py

# Check status
hivebox list

# Clean up
hivebox destroy myagent
```

### REST API

```bash
# Start the daemon
hivebox daemon --port 7070 --api-key mysecretkey

# Create a hivebox
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/v1/hiveboxes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecretkey" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "api-hivebox", "timeout": 3600}'

# Execute a command
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/v1/hiveboxes/api-hivebox/exec \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecretkey" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "python3 -c \"print(1+1)\""}'

# Destroy
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:7070/api/v1/hiveboxes/api-hivebox \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecretkey"
```

### MCP Bridge — Connect AI Agents to Sandboxes

HiveBox includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that bridges any AI coding agent into a sandbox. No custom agent loop — just plug your favorite MCP-compatible client (OpenCode, Claude Code, etc.) into any hivebox.

```
[AI Client] --HTTP--> [hivebox daemon :7070/mcp] --nsenter--> [Sandbox]
```

**Setup:**

1. Start the daemon and create a sandbox:
```bash
hivebox daemon --port 7070 --api-key mysecretkey
hivebox create --name myworkspace --memory 512m
```

2. Configure your AI client to connect via MCP over HTTP (no local binary needed):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sandbox": {
      "url": "http://your-server:7070/api/v1/hiveboxes/{HIVEBOX_ID}/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer mysecretkey" }
    }
  }
}
```

3. The AI client now has 16 tools to operate inside the sandbox: `exec`, `read_file`, `read_multiple_files`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_directory`, `directory_tree`, `search_files`, `glob`, `get_file_info`, `create_directory`, `move_file`, `upload_file`, `download_file`, `read_media_file`, `list_directory_with_sizes`.

### OpenCode Agent — AI per Sandbox

Each sandbox automatically gets its own [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) AI agent, accessible through the same daemon port. No extra setup — create a sandbox and start chatting.

OpenCode doesn't run *inside* the sandbox — it runs as a separate `opencode serve` process on the host, connected to the hivebox via MCP. The daemon proxies all requests through port 7070, so each sandbox's agent is accessible at `/api/v1/hiveboxes/{id}/opencode/` without exposing internal ports.

```bash
# Create a sandbox (opencode starts automatically)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/v1/hiveboxes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecretkey" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-agent"}'

# Connect to the real-time event stream (SSE)
curl -N http://localhost:7070/api/v1/hiveboxes/my-agent/opencode/event \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecretkey"

# Create a session
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/v1/hiveboxes/my-agent/opencode/session \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecretkey" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

# Send a prompt (response streams via SSE)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/v1/hiveboxes/my-agent/opencode/session/{SESSION_ID}/prompt_async \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecretkey" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"parts":[{"type":"text","text":"create a hello world script"}]}'
```

OpenCode is enabled by default. Disable it with `HIVEBOX_OPENCODE=false`.

### Web Dashboard

HiveBox includes a built-in web dashboard for managing hiveboxes from the browser.
Start the daemon and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:7070/dashboard
```

The dashboard provides:
- Login with API key
- Create, list, and destroy hiveboxes
- Built-in terminal to execute commands in any hivebox
- **Agent playground** with real-time SSE streaming for each hivebox
- Real-time hivebox status (uptime, TTL, resource usage, command count)
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

No external dependencies — everything is embedded in the binary.

## Architecture

HiveBox uses three components:

1. **Alpine Linux host** — unmodified vanilla Alpine (or any Linux with kernel 5.15+)
2. **`hivebox` binary** — single static Rust binary (~5 MB) managing hivebox lifecycle
3. **Rootfs image** — single Alpine base squashfs image mounted with overlayfs

### Six Layers of Isolation

Every hivebox is protected by six independent security layers:

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                  User Command                      |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|  6. seccomp-BPF     — syscall allow-list           |
|  5. Capabilities    — minimal privilege set         |
|  4. Landlock LSM    — filesystem path control       |
|  3. pivot_root      — filesystem isolation          |
|  2. cgroup v2       — resource limits               |
|  1. Namespaces      — process/net/mount/user        |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                  Linux Kernel                       |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

1. **Namespaces** (PID, Mount, Network, User, UTS, IPC) — complete process isolation
2. **cgroup v2** — memory, CPU, PID limits; swap disabled
3. **pivot_root** — host filesystem becomes unreachable
4. **Landlock LSM** — path-based filesystem access control
5. **Capability dropping** — minimal privilege set + `NO_NEW_PRIVS`
6. **seccomp-BPF** — syscall allow-list (~80 default, ~40 strict)

### Filesystem

Each hivebox uses overlayfs over squashfs base images:

```
merged/ (rw)      <- hivebox sees this
  +-- upper/ (tmpfs)    <- writes go here (vanishes on destroy)
  +-- squashfs/ (ro)    <- shared Alpine base across all hiveboxes
```

### Networking

Three modes: `none` (default, no network), `isolated` (NAT to internet), `shared` (bridge between hiveboxes).

## Building

Requires Rust toolchain. Target platform: Linux with kernel 5.15+.

```bash
# Development build
cargo build

# Static release build (for Alpine deployment)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# The binary is fully static — copy it anywhere
cp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/hivebox /usr/bin/
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t hivebox .

# Run with privileged mode and host cgroup namespace
docker run --privileged --cgroupns=host -p 7070:7070 \
  -e HIVEBOX_API_KEY=your-secret-key \
  hivebox
```

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HIVEBOX_API_KEY` | API key for authentication (`Authorization: Bearer <key>`) | *(none — auth disabled)* |
| `HIVEBOX_OPENCODE` | Enable OpenCode agent per sandbox (`true`/`false`) | `true` |
| `HIVEBOX_OPENCODE_BASE_URL` | Default LLM base URL for all sandboxes | *(opencode default)* |
| `HIVEBOX_OPENCODE_API_KEY` | Default LLM API key for all sandboxes | *(opencode default)* |
| `HIVEBOX_OPENCODE_MODEL` | Default LLM model for all sandboxes | *(opencode default)* |
| `HIVEBOX_OPENCODE_SKILLS_PATH` | Path to skills directory (mount custom skills) | `/root/.config/opencode/skills` |
| `HIVEBOX_OPENCODE_MCPS` | JSON of global MCP servers added to every sandbox | *(none)* |

All LLM and MCP settings can be overridden per-sandbox at creation time via the API (see [API docs](docs/api.md)).

> **Note**: `--privileged` is required for Linux namespaces, cgroups, and mount operations.
> `--cgroupns=host` gives access to the host cgroup hierarchy, needed for memory/CPU/PID limits on hiveboxes. Without it, hiveboxes still work but without resource limits.

## Deployment

### Build rootfs image

```bash
sudo bash scripts/build-images.sh
```

This builds the Alpine base squashfs image. To pre-install packages in all hiveboxes, add them to the Dockerfile or the base image build script. For per-hivebox packages, use `hivebox exec <name> -- apk add <package>`.

### Start the daemon

```bash
# Direct
hivebox daemon --port 7070 --api-key your-secret-key

# OpenRC (Alpine)
sudo cp config/hivebox.openrc /etc/init.d/hivebox
sudo rc-update add hivebox default
sudo rc-service hivebox start
```

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for full production setup.
